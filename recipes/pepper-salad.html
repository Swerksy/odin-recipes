        <h2>Yummy and Healthy Moroccan Salad</h2>

        <p>Today we&rsquo;re making a Moroccan pepper salad made with roasted bell peppers, tomato, spices, olive oil and vinegar. This refreshing side dish is wonderful served with bread or with any protein.</p>

        <p>This roasted pepper salad is one of my grandma&rsquo;s specialties, usually served amongst many other traditional Moroccan dishes like this tomato salad or carrot salad.

            The combination of the smokey roasted peppers with the acidity from the tomato and white vinegar creates a super flavorful salad that is anything but boring!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 red bell peppers</li>
                <li>3 green bell peppers</li>
                <li>1 fresh tomatoes, peeled</li>  
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
                <li>2 tbsp minced parsley</li>
                <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp white vinegar</li>
                <li>Moroccan bread to serve with salad</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Start by roasting your bell peppers  in the oven. Broil for 5 minutes or until black and charred, turning them with tongs every minute or so until they are charred and black on all sides.</li>
                <li>From there, cool your peppers on a plate for a few minutes before placing in a plastic zip lock bag for 10 minutes. This step helps the skin of the peppers to fall off easily. Once the 10 minutes has passed, a quick wipe with a paper towel should be enough to remove the skins from all the peppers. </li>
                <li>Next, remove the seeds and stems from the peppers and chop into bite sized pieces. Do the same with your tomatoes and toss the diced veggies into a serving bowl.</li>  
                <li>Season with olive oil, minced parsley, garlic, salt, cumin and a splash of vinegar. Mix well and serve with crusty bread.</li> 
            </ol>
