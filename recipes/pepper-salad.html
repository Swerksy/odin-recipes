        <h2>Yummy and Healthy Moroccan Salad</h2>

        <p>Today we&rsquo;re making a Moroccan pepper salad made with roasted bell peppers, tomato, spices, olive oil and vinegar. This refreshing side dish is wonderful served with bread or with any protein.</p>

        <p>This roasted pepper salad is one of my grandma&rsquo;s specialties, usually served amongst many other traditional Moroccan dishes like this tomato salad or carrot salad.

            The combination of the smokey roasted peppers with the acidity from the tomato and white vinegar creates a super flavorful salad that is anything but boring!</p>
